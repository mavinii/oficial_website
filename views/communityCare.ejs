                        At ARPC, we all have a variety of practical skills and gifts that we can share with 
                        other members, and by doing so, we strengthen our church community and demonstrate 
                        our love for one another.<br>

                        <br>The Community Care initiative (led by ARPC’s congregational committee) seeks to ensure 
                        that the needs of all our church community are met, especially at those times when 
                        church members experience challenging circumstances.<br>
                        
                        <br>We try to match the needs of our community with the services that members of our 
                        congregation may be able to offer each other.<br>
